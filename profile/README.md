# Logix - Real-time Log Visualization Platform
### Downtime ends today!!!

Welcome to **Logix**, a cutting-edge SaaS platform designed to simplify and enhance the process of log visualization. Whether you're monitoring microservices or large-scale distributed systems, Logix provides an intuitive and powerful interface to visualize logs in real-time, directly from your centralized logging systems like Kafka.

## Overview

Logix enables users to create customized dashboards to visualize logs from various sources. Users can create projects, organize logs into logical groups (stacks), and define specific schemas to visualize data in meaningful ways. The platform is designed to be flexible, supporting a wide range of log structures and providing insightful graphical representations of log data.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Log Analysis**: Visualize logs as they stream from your logging systems in real-time.
- **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects with unique configurations.
- **Stack Creation**: Organize logs into logical groups called stacks, each with its own set of identifiers.
- **Custom Log Schemas**: Define schemas for logs to structure and visualize data accurately.
- **Dynamic Graphs & Containers**: Effortlessly create and customize graphs and log containers to suit your needs.
- **Centralized Logging Integration**: Seamlessly connect to your Kafka, RabbitMQ, or other centralized logging systems.

## User Flow

### 1. Project Creation

Start by creating a new project within Logix. Here, youâ€™ll provide essential connection parameters to link Logix with your centralized logging systems, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ.

### 2. Stack and Signature Management

Within each project, users can create multiple logical groups known as stacks. Each stack can have one or more signatures, which serve as identifiers to categorize logs. For example, in a microservices architecture, each microservice can be represented as a stack with its own set of signatures.

- **Stacks**: Logical groups to categorize and manage logs.
- **Signatures**: Identifiers that help classify logs within a stack, such as Kafka topics or custom markers.

### 3. Schema Definition

For each signature, users can define a custom schema. This schema determines how the logs will be parsed and visualized. Logix supports a variety of schema configurations, allowing for precise data representation.

### 4. Visualization

With stacks and schemas in place, users can create and customize graphs and log containers. These tools provide a clear and interactive view of log data, making it easier to monitor, debug, and optimize your systems.

## Technical Terminology

- **Project**: A container for all related logs and configurations.
- **Stack**: A logical group within a project that categorizes logs.
- **Signature**: An identifier within a stack that helps classify logs.
- **Schema**: The structure that defines how logs are parsed and visualized.
- **Log Container**: A visual component that displays log data in a structured format.
- **Graph**: A visual representation of numerical log data.

## Use Cases

- **Microservices Monitoring**: Track and visualize logs across multiple microservices, each represented as a stack.
- **System Debugging**: Use real-time log data to identify and resolve issues quickly.
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze logs to optimize server performance and reduce downtime.
